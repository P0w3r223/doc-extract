## Does "the arithmetic holds" predict "the fields are right"?

The detector is `invariants.check` run on the **prediction**, never on the gold: the signal has to be available at inference time on a document nobody annotated.

| | flagged | silent |
|---|---:|---:|
| **fields wrong** | 35 | 49 |
| **fields right** | 0 | 28 |

| | |
|---|---:|
| prevalence | 75.0 % |
| precision | 100 % |
| recall | 41.7 % |
| F1 | 58.8 % |
| specificity | 100 % |
| localisation | 100 % (35 / 35) |

## Per rule

Precision only. A rule's recall is not a quantity this study can report: a document is wrong or not, and which rule *should* have caught it is not something the gold says.

| rule | fired on | of which wrong | precision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `lines.net_matches_quantity_times_price` | 35 | 35 | 100 % |

## Read this before the tables

* **This is a run over an attacked corpus, where one placement makes a correct reading look wrong.** The suite prints a payload inside an item's own description cell, and that description is a scored field — so a reader that transcribes the cell perfectly still differs from the gold there, by definition rather than by behaviour. Any `lines[].description` counted wrong below may be that rather than a misreading, and the `attack.md` beside this file is where the two are told apart.
* This is the **hard** half of the rule set, reported alone. Hard rules are arithmetic identities and a violation means something is genuinely wrong; heuristics have lawful exceptions. Pooling them would let a rule with known false positives borrow the precision of rules that have none.
* Localisation is reported apart from precision because it is a strictly weaker claim: a rule can be right that a document is broken and wrong about which field broke it.
